# vimfiles

My current .vim folder

## Why?

Several reasons:

* Couple friends of mine wanted me to share my .vim folder with them
* I want a fast way to synchronize my vimfiles between the computers I use
* It would be nice if I receive some ideas for handy plugins, settings, etc.

## How to install?

First of all backup your current ~/.vim/ and ~/.vimrc, clone this repository
in ~/.vim and run:

    cd ~/.vim
    make install
